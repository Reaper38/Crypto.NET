- Mapper for easy stream cipher encyrption with any symmetric algorithm in CFB, OFB or CTR mode
- RSA, Diffie-Hellman and an easy to use RSA-implementation
- SSL/TLS
- SecureNetworkStream, a class for encrypted network streams
- Key strengthening, HMAC
- Secure hash values of passwords through salt and key strengthening
- X509-Certificate builder for self-signed certificates
- ISAAC, a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator
